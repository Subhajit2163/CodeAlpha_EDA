# Titanic Survival Prediction Project
## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using various classification algorithms. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow from exploratory analysis to model deployment.
# Key Features
> Data Analysis: Comprehensive EDA to understand survival patterns

> Feature Engineering: Creation of new predictive features (titles, family size)

> Model Training: Multiple algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble methods

> Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

> Evaluation: Detailed performance metrics and visualizations

# Results
> Best model achieves 83% accuracy

> Key survival factors: gender, passenger class, and age

> Confirmed historical "women and children first" policy
