# Final Conclusion:
This project successfully predicts Titanic passenger survival with 83% accuracy using machine learning. Key findings confirm historical evacuation patternsâ€”women, children, and 1st-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates. The optimized XGBoost model, combined with feature engineering and ensemble methods, provides reliable predictions while maintaining interpretability. This end-to-end solution demonstrates the power of ML for historical analysis and serves as a strong foundation for binary classification tasks.

ðŸš€ Key Takeaway: Data-driven insights align with real-world events, validating both the model and historical accounts of the disaster.
